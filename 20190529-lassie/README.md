Topics:

 * Example format: Rmarkdown report linked to original paper and/or repo;
   confirm expectations and avoid assumptions; contributed four PRs for this
   tool due to the example
 * LASSIE functionality
 * Cotton SIV analysis
    * Fixed LASSIE version as git submodule
    * Modifications to expected workflow (transmitted founder timepoint)
    * Usual approach to self-contained analysis: datestamp; include small
      text-based data directly via git; short description in README.md with
      links as appropriate; Makefile or Snakefile
