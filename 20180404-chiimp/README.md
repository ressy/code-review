# 20180404-chiimp

Example:

 1. Download release ZIP from https://github.com/ShawHahnLab/chiimp/releases
 2. Extract, run install script
 3. Drag and drop YAML config file from demo dataset onto Desktop icon
 4. Open report HTML

Topics to discuss:

 * General R package structure (DESCRIPTION, R/, tests/)
 * example use of CHIIMP (drag and drop on three platforms)
 * Report features (credit Scott)
 * use as a standalone program (files in inst/bin)
 * bundling of rmarkdown report (files in inst/report; currently HTML)
 * configuration handling (YAML, lists, do.calls)
 * approach to unit tests (data generation -- is this reasonable?)
 * travis for R packages (channels, extra demo script)
